# Roblox-Account-Loginner
I have no idea why you would need this, but this is just for fun.
Clone this repository using
`git clone https://github.com/SkidExterminator/Roblox-Account-Loginner/edit/main`
(You need to install git, and type this in a thing called 'powershell' too.)
After that, you will want to go back to your powershell and type 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
