# Roblox-Account-Loginner
I have no idea why you would need this, but this is just for fun.
Clone this repository using
`git clone https://github.com/SkidExterminator/Roblox-Account-Loginner/edit/main`
(You need to install git, and type this in a thing called 'powershell' too.)
After that, download Google Chrome. (if you have it already, update it.), then
go to https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/ and download the 
latest chromedriver under your OS (Operating System). Then you run the python file
and log in to an account to play on I guess. (There's no captchas!)
